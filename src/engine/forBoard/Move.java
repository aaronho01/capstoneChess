/**
 * The Move class represents a move in a game of chess.
 * This abstract class provides the base functionality for all types of chess moves,
 * including standard moves, attack moves, castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
 * The class has been modified to support object pooling for better memory efficiency.
 * <p>
 * Different types of moves are represented by specialized subclasses, each implementing
 * the specific behavior and rules for that move type.
 * <p>
 * Alongside the existing {@link #execute()}/{@link #undo()} pair, which build an entirely new
 * {@link Board} to represent a transition, every move now also supports {@link #makeMove(Board)}
 * and {@link #unmakeMove(Board, UndoState)}, which mutate a given board in place and are reversed
 * through an {@link UndoState} rather than by holding onto a prior Board reference. Subclasses
 * whose {@link #execute()} behavior is a plain relocation do not need to override these; only
 * {@link PawnJump}, {@link PawnEnPassantAttack}, {@link CastleMove}, and {@link PawnPromotion}
 * override them, the same set of classes that already override {@link #execute()}.
