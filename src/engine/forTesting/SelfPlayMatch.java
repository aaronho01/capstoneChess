/**
 * The SelfPlayMatch class plays a match between two chess engines running as separate processes
 * and reports the result. It is the arbiter as well as the runner: it holds the only board that
 * counts, decides the outcome, and accepts a move only after resolving it against its own legal
 * moves, so an engine cannot end a game by claiming one.
 * <p>
 * Every opening is played twice, once with each engine as White, which is what a pair is. Both
 * engines are started once for the whole match and reused, and a new game is started on each of
 * them before every game, so the transposition table and the heuristic tables an engine holds
 * never carry from one game into the next.
 * <p>
 * Openings are drawn from a shuffle of the book seeded from the command line, since the book is
 * grouped by opening classification and taking its lines in order would play a match out of one
 * corner of it. The same seed draws the same openings, so a match can be repeated.
 * <p>
 * Both engines are told the position as the standard starting position followed by every move
 * played so far, including the moves of the opening, rather than as a position in
 * Forsyth-Edwards Notation. Replaying the whole game is what gives each engine the repetition
 * history a game actually has, which its own draw detection depends on.
 * <p>
 * Each engine searches under its own node limit, which the command line sets for both engines at
 * once or for one engine at a time.
 * <p>
 * Search threads are fixed at one for both engines. A node limit is only a meaningful measure of
 * equal effort while one thread is searching, since helper threads contribute nodes that the limit
 * does not account for.
 * <p>
 * A game that the engines agree is decided, or agree is level, is adjudicated rather than played
 * out, on the rules {@link Adjudicator} holds. A position that has already ended is judged on the
 * board before it is judged on the scores, so a checkmate is a checkmate rather than an
 * adjudicated win.
 * <p>
 * A match may also be stopped by the sequential test {@link MatchStatistics} holds, which ends it
 * as soon as the games have settled on one of two hypotheses rather than playing every pair asked
 * for. The test is weighed at the end of a pair rather than after a game, since the pair is what
 * balances the colours and a test read between the two games of one pair is read on a match that
 * gave one engine White more often than the other.
 * <p>
 * The arbiter uses the move generation of the build it was compiled from, not that of either
 * engine, so a move generation fault shared by both engines would be invisible here. That is what
 * {@link PerftSuite} covers.
