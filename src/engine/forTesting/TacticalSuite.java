/**
 * The TacticalSuite class runs the engine's search against positions whose winning move and
 * expected score are known and reports whether the engine produced both. This tests the
 * evaluation, move ordering, and pruning layers that a perft cannot reach, since a perft counts
 * nodes and is blind to which move is picked. A position is solved only when the engine both
 * chooses an accepted move and returns a score the position accepts, so a search that finds the
 * mate but reports the wrong distance to it fails.
 * <p>
 * A position may record moves to replay onto the board before the search begins, which is how a
 * position whose result depends on the moves that preceded it, such as a repetition, is expressed.
 * <p>
 * Each position is searched to a fixed depth rather than for a fixed time, so a run does not depend
 * on how fast the host is. Every position is searched by a freshly constructed engine that is shut
 * down once the position is finished, because the transposition table, evaluation cache, history
 * heuristic, and countermove table all survive a search and would otherwise make a result depend on
 * the order the positions are listed in.
 * <p>
 * Positions are searched on several worker threads at once, each running a single-threaded engine.
 * Nothing is shared between those engines, so a run reports the same result for every position
 * whatever order the workers happen to finish in. The engines themselves are single-threaded
 * because a parallel search reaches different results on different runs of the same position.
 * <p>
 * This class is designed to be run from the command line and its entry point returns a non-zero
 * exit status when any position is failed.

            A depth argument overrides the depth recorded against every position. Positions are
            recorded at a depth that keeps the tactic inside the search horizon with a margin, so
            overriding downwards is expected to fail some of them.

            A position is solved only when the engine both chooses an accepted move and returns a
            score inside the range recorded against the position, so a mate found at the wrong
            distance is a failure.

            The category flag restricts the run to the named categories, given in any case and
            separated by commas. The categories are mate, material, and draw. Positions are reported
            grouped by category whether or not the flag is given.

            The workers flag sets how many positions are searched at once, one by default. Every
            worker holds a transposition table for as long as its position is running, so raising
            it raises peak memory in proportion. A verbose run uses one worker whatever is asked
            for, so that the engine's own output stays readable.

            The suite exits with a non-zero status when any position is failed.""");
