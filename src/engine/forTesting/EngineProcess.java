/**
 * The EngineProcess class drives one chess engine running as a separate process and speaking the
 * Universal Chess Interface over a pipe. It starts the process, carries out the handshake, sends
 * the commands a self play game needs, and reads the replies. Running each engine as its own
 * process is what lets two builds of this engine, or two entirely different engines, play each
 * other without either one knowing the other exists.
 * <p>
 * Standard output of the process is the protocol channel and is read by a thread of this class
 * into a queue, so that every read can carry a deadline. Standard error is drained by a second
 * thread into a log file, since an engine that writes a stack trace and stops must not be able to
 * block by filling its error pipe. Both threads run as daemons and end when the process ends.
 * <p>
 * Every failure is reported as a {@link Fault}, including the ones that arrive as an
 * {@link IOException}, so that a caller playing a game has one thing to catch. A faulted process is
 * not usable afterwards and should be closed.
