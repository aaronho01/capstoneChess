/**
 * The Perft class counts the leaf nodes reachable from a position within a fixed number of plies.
 * A performance test, universally abbreviated to perft, walks the full legal move tree to a given
 * depth and counts only the positions at that depth. Comparing those counts against published
 * reference values proves whether move generation, move execution, and the special rules for
 * castling, en passant, and promotion are implemented correctly, since a single missing or spurious
 * move changes the count in a way that no amount of testing by inspection reliably reveals.
 * <p>
 * The class also provides a divide operation, which reports the node count contributed by each move
 * available at the root. Divide is the standard debugging tool for a failing perft: comparing the
 * per move subtotals against a reference engine identifies which branch contains the fault, and
 * repeating the process inside that branch narrows the fault to a single position. A Zobrist
 * consistency walk is provided alongside these, since the incrementally updated hash carried by each
 * board can be checked against a hash recalculated from scratch at every node of the same tree.
 * <p>
 * Every walk here mutates a single board in place through {@link Board#makeMove(Move)} and
 * {@link Board#unmakeMove()} rather than building a new board per move, which is the only way a
 * move is applied anywhere in the engine. A node count that matches a published reference value is
 * therefore also evidence that the unmake exactly reverses the make, since an imperfect reversal
 * leaves a corrupted position behind for every sibling move that follows it and the count diverges.
 * This class is designed as a non-instantiable utility class with static methods.
