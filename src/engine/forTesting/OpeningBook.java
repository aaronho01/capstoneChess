/**
 * The OpeningBook class reads the opening book used to start self play games and replays its lines
 * on a board. A book line is a sequence of moves from the standard starting position rather than a
 * position in Forsyth-Edwards Notation, so replaying it leaves a board carrying the same first move
 * status, castled status, repetition counts, and ply count that a game reaching the position would
 * carry. Loading the same position through {@link FenParser} cannot reproduce all of that, since
 * Forsyth-Edwards Notation does not record whether a knight, bishop, or queen has moved.
 * <p>
 * Each book line holds the moves in long algebraic notation, the ECO code, and the opening name,
 * separated by tabs. Blank lines and lines beginning with a hash are ignored, which is how the book
 * carries its provenance. Moves are resolved against the board they are played on rather than
 * parsed, so the notation this class accepts is exactly the notation
 * {@link Perft#longAlgebraicNotation(Move, Board)} produces.
 * <p>
 * Run from the command line, this class verifies a book: every line must replay legally from the
 * standard starting position, leave White to move in a position that is neither check nor terminal,
 * and reach a position no other line reaches. This class is designed as a non-instantiable utility
 * class with static methods.
