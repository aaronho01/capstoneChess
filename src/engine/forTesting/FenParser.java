/**
 * The FenParser class converts Forsyth-Edwards Notation strings into Board instances.
 * It exists so that arbitrary test positions can be loaded without playing a game up to them,
 * which is a prerequisite for move generation testing against published node counts.
 * The parser reads the piece placement, side to move, castling rights, en passant, halfmove
 * clock, and fullmove number fields. The two counter fields are optional, since a position may
 * be given without them, and default to a freshly started game when absent.
 * <p>
 * Castling rights and pawn double-step rights are expressed in this engine through the first
 * move status of the pieces involved rather than through a dedicated rights field, so the parser
 * translates the FEN castling field into the first move status of each king and rook, and marks
 * a pawn as unmoved only when it stands on its home rank. This class is designed as a
 * non-instantiable utility class with static methods.
