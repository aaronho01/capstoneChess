/**
 * The MatchStatistics record measures what a match came to. It holds the games one side won, lost,
 * and drew, and turns them into a score rate, an Elo difference, a confidence interval, and the
 * likelihood that the side is the stronger of the two.
 * <p>
 * Every figure is written from the point of view of the side the counts belong to, so a positive
 * Elo difference means that side is ahead.
 * <p>
 * The interval is a normal approximation taken on the score rate and then written as Elo through
 * the same logistic the point estimate uses. Its standard error is taken from the wins and draws
 * the match actually held rather than from an assumed draw rate. An endpoint that reaches a score
 * rate of zero or one is unbounded and is reported as such.
 * <p>
 * Each game is counted on its own, which leaves out the pairing of the openings a match is played
 * from. The two games of a pair are correlated, so an interval taken this way is wider than one
 * taken over pair results.
 * <p>
 * A match whose games all ended the same way has a standard error of zero and no interval can be
 * taken from it. A match of nothing but wins or nothing but losses is instead reported with a one
 * sided bound taken from the binomial, and a match of nothing but draws is reported with no
 * interval at all.
 * <p>
 * These counts also carry a sequential test, which weighs a null hypothesis and an alternative
 * hypothesis against one another and reports which of the two the games have settled on, or that
 * they have settled neither. The test is the log likelihood ratio of a normal model whose variance
 * is the one the match itself measures, so it is an approximation of the ratio rather than the
 * ratio of the trinomial the games really come from. It is stated in {@link SequentialTest} and
 * read through {@link #logLikelihoodRatio} and {@link #conclude}.
